I need access to a kitchen and common areas & want to be able to have my own stuff mixed in with someone - so their home is my home, too. 3) find a house/townhouse/condo I can afford to rent on my own until I find a roommate 4) if push comes to shove, I will get my own place. It’s just so taxing on me to pay rent and all expenses when I am not home regularly. 5) if only renting a bedroom with access to other areas of a home, but unable to have anything other than my clothing - I need rent to be based on that."

black,middle,25,"Hey!! ____I’m Angellica and I’m looking for a room for Bentley and I. About Bentley: • He’s 3 years old and a Yorkie/Shitzu mix. • He is super friendly towards other dogs and people. • He isn’t a free roaming dog right now (when we leave my room he’s always on a leash lol) and can be crated when I’m not home. • He is surprisingly quiet lol. About me: • I work for an elementary school as an assistant teacher in Atlanta. • My hobbies are making rugs, rollerskating, photography, movies, traveling and hiking. • I’m a natural homebody and am super quiet. I’m always conscious of keeping shared spaces clean, because if I don’t I feel guilty lmao. Overall I’m just very considerate of others. I’m looking to pay anything from $600-700. I don’t have a set date that I want to move, so I’m super flexible! I’d love to room with mainly girls, but will be open to the idea of guys too. "
white,middle,35,"I’m looking for a place with roommates or roommates to find a house with. I am also open to living in an insulated shed/garage space that is separate from the house if anyone has a space they’d like to use to make a little extra cash. I’m a 30 year old woman, recently graduated with a Master’s of Occupational Therapy. I would define myself mostly as an artist who loves to write and dance but also committed to serving others. I am active outdoors with trail running, hiking and often take meditative walks. I am a community oriented person looking for a group of people to help each other thrive. I love my alone time too and find it helps me feel rejuvenated. I have a young dog, a Border Collie/Australian Shepherd mix who is a part of the package. A place with a fenced in backyard is ideal although not a deal breaker. I like to keep common spaces tidy but not anal about it. I have many plants that come with the package too that I believe make a home feel homier - they can stay in my room or be used around the house. My ideal move in date would be sometime in April or May, $700/month or less, in East Atlanta Village, Reynoldstown, or West End, East Point, or College Park. Let me know if you are interested or have a lead. Thanks so much!"

If anyone knows of one in Midtown ATL from this month(March) until middle or late May please message me. I’m going to South America in May to end of July but will be traveling during the month of September. So I will need to find a place in town close to my job until I leave. I work at a yoga studio in midtown but am going to south America for a couple Yoga retreats. I am planning on taking my dog with me so if we wanted to continue the lease while I’m gone and rent out my room while I’m away that wouldn’t be a problem either. Furnished rooms are a plus since I am okay with not taking my things out of storage but unfurnished is okay too. *The only special requirement is that I have a 8year old female King Charles cavalier who is non energetic and only wants to sleep. She is housebroken and it the best. So anywhere who allows pets would be great! **Would be available to continue lease once I get back if we get along! Thank you guys so much!!"

white,middle,27,"Looking for someone to take over my lease in a 2b/1br. Would prefer to move out Mid-Late May, but I can possibly make April work if you need to be in there sooner. Rent fluctuates from mid $600s-mid $700s depending utilities. Apartment is located in the Kirkwood area within walking distance of several parks, a few restaurants, a nice coffee shop, and a library. Bus stop right outside the front door. Laundry in unit. Roommate is a grad student, very chill and quiet and has a sweet, beautiful all-white German Shepherd who is great with other dogs and people (no cats, unfortunately).

The lease would start May 1 and rent is $710/ mo plus power and internet. Water is covered in the rent... The apartment gets so much natural light and I keep indoor plants, so it has kind of a lush feel to it.  The best thing about this place, IMHO is the community farm just steps off of our covered patio! We get produce and eggs from the farm at no extra charge! There is a fire pit and a bunch of spots to just hang out and chill on the farm as well. Fun facts about me... I am a graphic designer, plant enthusiast, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu purple belt. I am working from home at the moment and I have 2 sweet, sweet kitties, Margo and Eleanor who always want pets and love. We are allowed 3 pets total in the apartment, so we technically have room for 1 more. Cats preferred bc energetic dogs kind of freak my cats out. Edit: My cats are indoor-outdoor and they use a cat door to get in and out. Please keep in mind if you have a kitty too! Looking to confirm with the complex ASAP!"

white,middle,23,"Hi all! My name is Timo (he/him) and I’m looking for up to a 12-month lease with 1-2 roommates. I've lived in the EAV area for almost a year and have loved it, but I'm flexible on location. My budget is $1k/mo with utilities included. I'm an ally, and I currently live with 5 women as roommates, so you can expect me to understand and respect boundaries. You can depend on me if you need a ride, someone to vent to, or just someone to be there as a friend! Oh, and I don't have any pets. A little about me: I’m half Canadian and half Puerto Rican, and I speak both Spanish and English. I was raised Hispanic, so you can count on me being clean (iykyk). I enjoy quality time with my friends, but quiet time is also very important to me. I’m currently a senior at Georgia State studying Public Health and Computer Informations Systems. I'm also a public health consultant for GHC3 and an EHR specialist for a pediatric office. I’m an F1 and soccer nut, but I’m also big into music production and audio engineering. I play drums, guitar, keys, bass… you name it. I freelance and have produced songs for bands here and there around ATL as well as my own stuff from time-to-time. I’m always down to listen to/create some tunes! Don't worry about the noise, I almost always use headphones as I prefer them to speakers."
white,middle,30,"Hi Everyone. I’m looking to find a summer/short-term sublease within the Atlanta area. No real preference on location but was hoping to find somewhere within my $1500 budget. Any recommendations would be very much appreciated! ABOUT ME: I’m 26 years old; I work as a Marketing Solutions Specialist with ESPN and I also work in an Operations Lead for a small sports media startup in Atlanta. I grew up on Long Island, NY and Portland, ME, went to UMass Amherst for school, lived in NYC for a few years (Bronx and Upper East Side) but am looking to make the move to ATL now that I am working from home. I’m an avid fan of exercise and outdoors and so would love to be around any hiking trails and gyms and really enjoy everything relating to sports media content creation (I’ve hosted radio shows and podcasts in the past, done a little bit of drone videography, and am managing a few professional social media accounts). I’m really into music (can listen to anything but can converse for hours on hip-hop, R&B, Soul), video games (particularly NBA 2K) and comedy TV Shows/Movies (huge fan of Curbed, Dave, and Schitts Creek) but can appreciate any art-form. I’m definitely interested in finding an awesome place to live, with or without roommates, but hopefully with people who ideally share some of these qualities! Typical things like neatness, proactive communication, and good energy. But, even more, it would be amazing to share a space with people whom I can develop an eventual friendship with! Would love to meet people who share a collective interest in making the place feel like “home”. No gender preference either, as I was most recently living with 2 girls and 1 guy and had no preference to when I was living with 3 guys. If this seems like a great fit, please shoot me a message telling me about yourself! I’m also super happy to answer any questions you might have! Would love to follow up over any Zoom as well!"

white,middle,25,"Hi everyone! My name is Mirage and my current lease ends in July. I was going to move back in with my parents to save money, but things have happened. I plan on attending GGC in the fall and as of right now currently work in Alpharetta. So any location between those two would be great, or near Alpharetta, Gwinnett County area, or maybe near Brookhaven/Decatur if affordable. This would be mid-July/beginning of August. I love socializing and meeting others so I’m looking to move in with someone who would be a great, cleans after themselves and someone with similar interest. I love music, fashion, animals, the ocean as well. Sounds weeby, but Naruto has helped me a lot emotionally/mentally so if you love that show as much as me we’ll get along! I’m more of a social drinker especially if you’d like to have good night in’s or night out’s. As much as I love socializing, I am very much an introvert as I usually keep to myself in my room. As long as you are respectful of noise and having people over, it’s not a huge issue for me. I did get approved for a breeder recently and plan on adopting a dog probably around the Winter time. I’m an only child and have been wanting a new dog since mine passed away in high school. I will train it and make sure it is very obedient and loving and I am looking for a roommate who is okay with that. It’s exhausting when people talk about having their own pets, but their roommates can’t have any. Other than that, I’m pretty easy to get along with as long as it is not a toxic environment and we are respectful of each other’s spaces. I am 25 years old if she matters! I would like to have my own bathroom, but if not it’s doable. My current budget is $500-$600 and would prefer a home style place than an apartment, but I could deal with an apartment as long as the neighbors aren’t too loud and terrible lol."
