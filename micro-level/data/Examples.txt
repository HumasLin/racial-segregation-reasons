Have definitely had this conversation with my parents a few times. They grew up in Atlanta but moved to the burbs in the 70s. When my wife and I were buying a house this past year, I mentioned that we'd love to live in Grant Park but we can't afford it. They thought I was crazy. I had to drive them through the area for them to finally believe me when I said Grant Park is a great neighborhood for families.I grew up in that neighborhood as a kid. The amount of beautiful woods in that area is hard to beat. In the Late 70’s my family would only turn on the air conditioning for 6 weeks in the summer to get the humidity out of the house. An attic fan under hundred year old trees was really comfortable. When we did turn on the A/C my bedroom downstairs would get so cold I used blankets in the summer. 

The only sad part is how much better it was in the 60’s before all the development. I live in Athens Ga now and it has 3 small rivers that meet just south of town. 

Both Atlanta and Athens have seen a huge improvement in downstream water since the water sewage treatment was raised to modern standards.I live within walking distance of Krog Street Market and I really miss being able to take advantage of that. Meet friends for lunch at Superica, stroll over to Pour for a drink or two, meander down the Belt Line to New Realm, ride an obnoxious scooter to Orpheus. Sunday afternoon Belt Line bar crawls are what I’m looking forward to. Someday when the East and West sides are connected I want to scooter/bike and hit Wild Heaven, Monday Night, New Realm, and Orpheus all in one go.I'm not sure about now - but I used to live right near Porch Light when it first open.  I've had some of the most personable dining experiences there.  Their dinning room is incredibly small and the owner was always there.  He always remembered mine and my wife's names and our favorite drinks even though we 'only' went there maybe once a month or so.Are there really 3BR apartments for $1200 in Midtown or did I misunderstand? I live in Dunwoody and pay $1500 for a 1BR, but have been looking to move somewhere cheaperChamblee would also be a cheap option and is on the gold line (just one stop up from brookhaven). The Marta station is also super close to a wal-mart, and Chamblee's downtown, which has a few bars/restaurants, as well as a lot of new development around peachtree.

Honestly, I like Chamblee more than Brookhaven, but either will be good. It's probably going to be cheaper to live closer to the marta station as well in Chamblee.Beg and plead for them to place you in the "midtown" location (it's actually just south of midtown), because life will be a breeze without a car in that case - you can live in downtown/midtown/Lindbergh/Buckhead and have easy no car commutes to work via the MARTA train. Midtown is definitely the best to be car free, but it's also the most expensive, probably. Lindbergh would certainly be the cheapest. If you need cheaper than that, look south of downtown. 

If it might be the other location, it becomes a bit more complicated. The #6 bus from Lindbergh runs every 15 minutes during rush hour to Emory, so Lindbergh is still a solid option.I live in Cabbagetown and one of my buddies and I like to go down to the park to throw around a football as well. We're pretty COVID conscious but would probably be down to throw the ball / run some routes in the next few weeks with appropriate distancing and/or masks.I work for a popular tech startup in Denver and we’ve been expanding and opening new offices around the country in the past year. I’ve been waiting for the locations on the east coast hoping one would be ATL so I can move back home. So, I find out the new offices will be in NYC, Boston, and... Charlotte. I have no desire to live in Charlotte. 

Not a huge deal but *sigh*I live right down the road. Tucker is on the upswing! It's one of those satellite cities that's gonna fill in as prices increase, I'm sure. I get the sense, like others, that the sense of community is very big there.Anyone in this sub live in the Tucker area? I’m looking at purchasing a house there (I’ve found it’s still pretty affordable there in comparison) and would love to hear from anyone who lives there what they think. 

Pre-covid I’m pretty basic. A few good bars and restaurants and dog parks and i’m a happy ladyMirkwood is good but it’s so far from the Connector, I couldn’t live there (for commute reasons). Try looking in Peoplestown and Summerhill too.I live in Adair park which has gotten pretty pricy but I will say you should look at Pittsburgh. Lots of houses coming up there that aren’t super pricy. The neighborhood is definitely a little rough still, but if you’re looking to stay on the SW side, I definitely recommend taking a look!Westside resident chiming in. 

My uncle is a building developer for many of the townhome-style buildings you see popping up around Westside. Something like 25% of what they build they HAVE to sell as “affordable housing” so that lower-income families still have the opportunities to live in these new neighborhoods.

The neighborhood I live in is incredibly diverse. On our street alone, there’s 2 mixed families, a gay couple, an older white family, 3 black families, an Asian family 2 white families, and a group of renters - some Latino, some black. Westside isn’t about “pushing out” other black families that have lived here for generations, it’s about developing a (struggling) community. These houses were $150,000 ten years ago brand new and now they’re roughly $400,000 because of how much its blossomed in such a short time.

My neighborhood is wonderful, but many of our cars get broken into (and some stolen) because we’re a street turn away from the rougher edges of Bankhead... cops are called on crimes, not on parties.I live on the north side of Scottdale and I like it here. Our neighborhood is mostly quiet and people are pretty friendly. I enjoy the proximity to YDFM and we're maybe a 10 minute drive to Decatur at most. Really easy to get to the PATH trails if you want to walk/run/bike. Houses in our neighborhood continue to go on sale or get flipped. Our home value has increased by $15-20k in the short time we've lived here. In my neighborhood at least, it seems to be a mix of older couples and young families. I feel like it's a good place for my family to get started. Development seems to be slowly creeping this direction via North Druid Hills and Decatur but I think it's going to be a while before any significant growth happens.

Only cons I've encountered so far are...
Consistent noise from 285 being nearby (mostly just sirens). North Dekalb Mall is basically dead and I wish something could revitalize that place. You get to play fireworks or gunshots sometimes. Keep your car doors locked for the occasional rando checking doors at night. I've never felt unsafe here though. If you've lived in a city before, most of this shouldn't be anything out of the norm anyway.I'll bite. You certainly *can* live anywhere without a car.  As to if it would be cost effective, or possible for the average person living there to do it, that starts to be open for debate.  VaHi makes sense... Given it is nextdoor to Midtown it is a quick bike commute.

Where are you working in Reynoldstown? Grocery shopping?  (Especially five or ten years ago?) If you just bike everywhere or Marta everywhere more power to you, but if you are a 100% remote software developer (I basically am, so I'm not being a hater here) that makes enough money to just Uber or get everything delivered, you can live in Forsyth without a car.... It doesn't mean it is practical for most residents.I’ll second test. We almost got a cake from here because I had so many people recommend that I go to this location specifically. We ended up not going with a bakery, but I live close by to this Publix now and they have exceptional service in general and a really nice cake Consultation area￼￼￼Poncey-highland! I live and teach in the area. Great public schools, friendly neighborhood, very walkable, super close to freedom park and beltline!Former Midtown resident even before the big construction boom of the last ten years 

Even 2007-2011 I was able to live without a car no problem - walked everywhere, even took the bus to areas like Little 5, etc (this was also before Uber) and I rented a Zipcar every two weeks or so for just an hour or two for big errands like massive grocery store haulsAs a middle-aged woman who lives in Midtown, I love it here.  So many restaurants, and really no need for a car.  Walking distance to a Whole Foods, a Publix, doctor's offices, the post office.  Yes, some restaurants closed, but it is a wonderful place to live.There’s been talk of altering streets that have been linked to this closure so possibly. The region just needs better public transport. We live OTP but if MARTA rail came down here, I’d happily take the train to work. Give people like me better reasons to use MARTA and you all can get quieter streets. But you mention MARTA where we live and,....well you all know how it goes.Where are you commuting to, and what are you looking for in your neighborhood?  I live near Bolton Rd. ITP. $225k won't go very far ITP unless you go further south like Grove Park and closer to I20.  The only ITP house for $225k north of the tracks has been crushed by a big tree.  There is a [cute new house](https://www.redfin.com/GA/Atlanta/1424-Bolton-Rd-NW-30331/home/24834106) over on Bolton Rd. for $225k.  You'll get some nicer options out towards Mabelton and western Smyrna.I already decided not to after visiting the area that the BEAUTIFUL house with the AMAZING backyard at a great price is located around dark. The girlfriend was harassed and someone asked me "What chu need"?

The last time I heard that I was 16 looking for.... It doesn't matter 🤣.

Either way between the insane prices per KWH with no flat bill option, a water bill that has a BASE rate higher than my highest water bill in the past decade in clayton county, the homeless population very near the place, someone soliciting me for drugs, and the girl being harassed. On top of it there have been plenty of racial issues in the past year, and being in an interracial relationship I would prefer to not be in an area where we both feel unsafe before any national chaos starts.


TLDR: We decided there are many eeasons not to live in East point, and 0 incentives to move there.


Thanks to all who posted to help with the original question!Where will your husband be working and what is your housing budget?  That will help us give you an idea of where to look.

The traffic isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be if you live in or close to town and aren't commuting from 40 miles outside of town.  Reddit posters will make it sound like everyone who drives spends hours of their life daily sitting in standstill traffic while they gleefully walk and take public transit five minutes from everywhere.  My daily commute is about 26 miles each way from a little bit northwest of midtown to several miles outside the perimeter on the east side.  Even on the worst days, it's like 45 minutes.  It's usually about 35.Where is your husbands office at?  What is your budget for a home?  Do you care about living in a good school district?  
  
With those three questions answered I could make some recommendations.  Atlanta traffic can really suck so I normally recommend people try to live as close to their office as reasonably possible.  After that, it really comes down to budget and that can be heavily impacted by if you need to live in a good school district or not.Good ole Post Oak Tritt Road. Use to live on that in Roswell many years ago. Soon to be on the west coast though and I’ll miss the area and Atlanta!Atlanta metro may seem overwhelming, but each little neighborhood and small city within it is it's own little place and is not overwhelming at all. I live a few miles from midtown and it's pretty quiet and peaceful. The traffic isn't even that bad. If you can, avoid living far from work and having to use the interstate for the majority of your commute.We're over by Emory and I think the 1 bedroom condos where we live rent for $1800.  And we're in the old, falling down, but mostly crime-free safe kinda place.We are staying in our area in NW Atlanta (Bolton mostly).  We are just looking for a bigger house.  We've lived in the same single-car townhome for over 15 years and now have an eight-year-old.  There are no kids in our current neighborhood and nowhere for him to play, and the house just isn't big enough for us to comfortably live in any more.  So, we're looking for a substantial upgrade!Used to live down the street from one of the most infamous skate cribs in Atlanta history. It was one block up from the park. They had a massive half pipe kitted out with skatelite donated from thrasher magazine. Every hardcore skater in ATL shredded there at some point. The Massive rent parties on the 4th were legendary. No permit. never had an issue. 

Just be smart and respectful of your neighbors. Maybe even let them know what your planning. knuckleheads will totally screw things up for you so keep that in mind. Now go forth and build that ramp and stay shredding.This is the answer. Most any solo places ITP under 1k have been bought up and torn down. If you want close to north east, north or north west close to 285, its not going to happen. It would have to be east, near six flags, or straight west on I20. Not ideal places to live. Also south of 285, not ideal near the perimeter at those prices. 

So, again, how many roommates do you want?I live in EP, both my wife and I work from home 5-6 days a week. Our electric bill is between $100-$150 per month. As others have said, outages are fixed quickly and the city is able to monitor everything. In October, city officials called me to let me know that I had a water leak because they noticed that my water usage can gone up significantly within a week. They also walked me through the process of getting my bill adjusted which I really appreciated. EP has its issues just like everywhere else, but all in all it is a good place to live.Yes the bills are a bit higher but it does come with some benefits (I have lived in EP since 2012)
- we have our own power, water, and trash company(city controlled) . Any outages are fixed quickly since we aren’t waiting for Georgia power to get to hundreds of thousands of outages. 

The bills include power, water, sewer trash and recycling. I live in a 1300 sq foot 1948 house with old windows, examples below: 

Bill last month: $154 
Bill last August: $335I live by this place and go once a week or so. Love it here!I live in midtown and I’m new to the area. Was in a major cycling incident with a vehicle back in September (solo training ride), so I’m just looking for safety in numbers while trainingI love Atlanta! I considered moving there after retirement, but *THE TRAFFIC*!! My husband went to GA Tech back in the day and his sister and her whole family live there, but OMG the traffic...


... so we moved to Savannah instead. But I love coming up to visit ❤️I haven’t made it out to Arabia yet, nor have I made it to Rocktown since that WMA is closed to everyone except hunters during the winter. 


And yeah Zahnd is a ways out, but my personal perspective is skewed on what’s “close,” since I’m primarily a mountain biker, and what I like riding is backcountry stuff in the mountains, and that’s ALL min. 75 minutes from where I live OTP right now. 


I’ve contemplated getting into bouldering before but it scares me to do it alone and I don’t like people haha. But I do want to go to Panola soon.> I'll pay good money to have time spent not in a car.

Oh I am 100% with you here. I've never been able to walk to work, but my commute is <20 minutes now. When I first moved to Atlanta and my job was more central (Downtown), my commute was ~10 minutes. I had coworkers who were like why not live further out and save money on rent? But to me it was worth living in town and paying more, being closer to my friends, not sitting in traffic for an hour and not putting wear and tear on the crappy car I drove at the time.I have limited experience in that area, but I can say for sure I have no desire to live there. It was already bad, traffic wise, before the massive warehouse expansion. This looks insane.

It’s like all the negatives of living in the northern suburbs with none of the benefits. Great work HenryIt was one of my city exploration day almost a year ago 
when I moved to Atlanta. I saw the gorgeous sunset view from the same spot. Now I live there!It really depends on where you’re at. I live near some great areas with decent bike infrastructure... but in every instance I have to travel on a multi lane road/highway with average speeds exceeding 45mph for at least a short distance of time to get to those areas.  The Complete Streets project slated for Howell Mill will go a long way in fixing that for me personally.  I also have a small (toddler) child who often rides with me so my tolerance for risk is very low.I currently live in BP, and like others have said, it’s block by block. I bought my house a year and a half ago. It’s a good investment for me since my mortgage is just under what I was paying in rent at my previous place. I have a decent size yard which was a selling point for me. I don’t mind driving to things (I do my grocery shopping at the East Lake Publix, not the Kroger in Belvedere Plaza). The property taxes are relatively low compared to what my friends over near EAV and such are paying. My former roommate actually just bought a house in the area as well. I’ve found it to be a mix of residents who have lived here for a while and others who are on their starter homes. I really like my street and my neighbors, and overall I feel safe. I also have 2-3 dogs (medium/large) at any given point, and Ring doorbell. I’m happy to chat more in specifics if you have any questions; just send me a PM.

Edit: a word> Speaking of appliances, roaches can live, unbeknownst to you, in microwaves, laptops, behind fridges. Basically everything that gets warm. Those are the hardest to clean out but it can be done.

UGH Can confirm. I grew up in Florida with no AC with hoarder parents in a house where you could see light from outside where the addition was put on in the 50s. When I moved out at age 18 I had to get all new alarm clocks and stuff. Im still not sure how they werent in my tv other than I refused to eat in my room.
